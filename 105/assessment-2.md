**After two weeks, what do you think is going to be your biggest challenge with this program? And how will you try to overcome it?**

  An issue I had with high school was never properly studying for anything. I did fine in my classes, but not the best I could do. It might be hard for me to put in the time to study, but I hope that I am able to. To overcome this, I may just have to close Discord and Steam as you had suggested so I won't get distracted. It may just be that the things we are learning now are not new to me, and I will have an easier time studying when we are learning concepts that I have never used.

**Describe the differences between the three styles of loops: for, while, and do...while.**

  There are three types of loops, for, while, and do while. A while loop will loop while some conditions are being met. For instance, you can create a while loop that adds 1 to a total until the total equals 5. A for loop is similar, but you can tell it in the initialization how many times it will repeat. The while loop is good if you do not know how many times it will repeat. The do while loop allows you to do something, then go into the while loop. It will always do something at least once, unlike the other loops, which can run 0 times. 

**We've learned to split problem solving into two parts: writing the solution in English or pseudocode, then translating the solution into JavaScript. Why is this important and how will it help you in future classes?**

  Using pseudocode is important to solve problems easily. It allows you to put your thought process in simple English. Jumping straight into the code can be overwhelming and confusing. It will help in future classes as the solutions become more and more complex. Jumping into code may be impossible without a written plan. Personally, I struggle with the pseudocode due to prior experience allowing me go straight into coding for simple problems, but I can certainly understand how it will be important in the future. I am trying to write more pseudocode, but habits are hard to break.
