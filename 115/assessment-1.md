**Now that you've spent a few weeks working on longer projects, how do you think you'll adapt to working in the professional world?**

I still think I've got a long ways to go before I will be comfortable working professionally. I am definitely a lot more confident than when I began. I feel like I will be fine.

**Imagine you are building your Choose-Your-Own-Adventure project in JavaScript for the browser. The user has clicked a button to select which room to enter, walk through how you would manipulate the page to show the next room's description. Explain the DOM methods you would use and why.**

If I were building the Choose-Your-Own-Adventure game for the browser, I would begin by creating a new text element. I would then fill it with the appropriate contents. I think this would be a fun thing to do. I would probably create images as well, and replace them for each new scene.

**Why are different data structures useful? Use the Document Object Model as an example. Would it work as any structure other than a tree?**

There are specific data structures that work more effectively for some tasks than the more general ones. They are very important because they help set everything up correctly. I think that the DOM could also work as nested objects.
