**Why do you think it's important that HTML is an open standard controlled by a specification rather than being owned by one person or company?**

I think that it is very important that HTML is open because it allows anyone to use it. I feel like if everyone had the same resources that some huge companies do, we would probably progress as a society much faster. HTML being open source means that anyone can make a website easily. If it was not open source, I don't think the internet would be even close to the way it is now.

**Describe the difference between an element and a tag. Use examples.**

The difference between an element and a tag is that the element consists of the tags as well as the content between them. The opening and closing tags will wrap some sort of content, and then that entire thing becomes an element. Elements can also have attributes that change things. These are opening and closing tags: \<p> \</p>. Putting something between them, like this, \<p>Hey\</p> makes an element.

**In the lecture, I used two quotes from Yoda and Noam Chomsky to explain syntax and semantics. Explain these quotes and how they relate to the HTML you write.**

Syntax refers to the rules of some language. For instance, while Yoda saying "The greatest teacher, failure is" makes sense, it is still syntactically incorrect. Semantically, on the other hand, follows the rules of some language, but does not make sense. This is demonstrated by Noam Chromsky's quote, "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously". Both syntax and semantics must be basically perfect for the computer to read our code.
