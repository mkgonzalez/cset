**We learned Web Development because it is a standard way to create user interfaces across platforms, but then we learned all of the non-standard aspects that we have to look out for. What does that tell you about building other platform specific user interfaces?**

If this is as simple as it is going to get, I would assume that other methods require a lot more knowledge of the specificities. I am thinking about things such as operating systems and the differences between computer part manufactureres. I am sure that it will be difficult.

**Show two examples of CSS Media Queries that use different Media Features. Explain how the user agent will decide to use those rulesets or not.**

CSS Media Queries allow the styles to change based on the user's device. For instance, they can be used to change how a website looks if the width and height are small or big. They can also target the orientation of the device and the resolution. They are very useful for designing a website that can look good on all devices. A website can look completely different on a phone and a computer.

**Do you think it is better to define Breakpoints using standard device sizes or using the specific content on your site? Why?**

I think it is better to use the standard device sizes, but it easier to make it based on your site. Using standard device sizes will more accurately allow you to determine which version of the site to show to a user. You do not want someone on their phone to see the desktop website.
