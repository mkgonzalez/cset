**In your opinion, what is the most important thing you learned this week? Why?**

  I think the most important thing that I have learned is how JavaScript is different than the languages I've used previously. It seems to be less "rigid" than Java or Python, in that it tries to do things that aren't obvious at times. I am excited to begin programming to see how my previous knowledge will translate to this new language. It is important because it is new to me, and I am interested in using it.
  
**Describe the general idea of high and low level programming languages using the concept of abstraction.**

  Low level programming languages have little to no abstraction, while high level languages have plenty. Put simply, it's how similar the language is to the languages we speak. Assembly, for instance, is much less legible to a beginner than Java would be. Abstraction is used because it gets rid of the unnecessary details and only displays things that are important, rather than simply telling the computer which bits to flip, which should increase the ease and speed of programming.
  
**JavaScript was designed to be flexible with values and types, often jumping back and forth between them. Compare some pros and cons of this decision. How might it help you? How might it get in the way?**

  I think that the pros might outweigh the cons when using JavaScript. Theoretically, having to juggle types and stuff will be slower than simply having the language do it for you. However, it is likely to be more prone to error and unintended conversions. If you are good at JavaScript, though, the errors may not occur often. It was certainly annoying having to cast things in Java, and I am interesting in seeing if I like it. Thankfully, to avoid the automatic type conversions, there are the "===" and "!==" operators, which I will probably use at the beginning out of fear. Another thing- I've noticed in any community in which there is a manual and automatic way to do something, there will be elitists who will scoff at anyone who dares to use automatic over manual. I'm assuming that's a thing in this field as well.
